/// @title Fast withdrawal agent implementation. With the help of liquidity providers (LPs),
///        exchange operators can convert any normal withdrawals into fast withdrawals.
///
///        Fast withdrawals are a way for the owner to provide instant withdrawals for
///        users with the help of a liquidity provider and conditional transfers.
///
///        A fast withdrawal requires the non-trustless cooperation of 2 parties:
///        - A liquidity provider which provides funds to users immediately onchain
///        - The operator which will make sure the user has sufficient funds offchain
///          so that the liquidity provider can be paid back.
///          The operator also needs to process those withdrawals so that the
///          liquidity provider receives its funds back.
///
///        We require the fast withdrawals to be executed by the liquidity provider (as msg.sender)
///        so that the liquidity provider can impose its own rules on how its funds are spent. This will
///        inevitably need to be done in close cooperation with the operator, or by the operator
///        itself using a smart contract where the liquidity provider enforces who, how
///        and even if their funds can be used to facilitate the fast withdrawals.
///
///        The liquidity provider can call `executeFastWithdrawals` to provide users
///        immediately with funds onchain. This allows the security of the funds to be handled
///        by any EOA or smart contract.
///
///        Users that want to make use of this functionality have to
///        authorize this contract as their agent.
