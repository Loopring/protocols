# Loopring 3.0

## Introduction

In Loopring Protocol 3 we want to improve the throughput of the protocol significantly. We do this by using zk-SNARKs -- as much work as possible is done off-chain, and we only verify the work on-chain.

For the highest throughput, we only support off-chain balances. These are balances that are stored in Merkle trees. Users can deposit and withdraw tokens to our smart contracts, and their balance will be updated in the Merkle trees. This way we can transfer tokens between users just by updating the Merkle tree off-chain, there is no need for expensive token transfers on-chain.

In the long run, we still want to support on-chain transfers due to reasons such as:

- It may be impossible to deposit/withdraw security tokens to the smart contract
- Users may prefer to keep funds in their regular wallets for security reasons

Note that there is never any risk of losing funds when depositing to the smart contract. Both options are trust-less and secure.

Data availability for the Merkle tree is an option that can be turned on or off when creating exchange built on Loopring. When data-availability is enabled, anyone can recreate the Merkle tree just by using the data published on-chain.

## Trading with Off-chain Balances

### Apparent Immediate Finality

Off-chain balances are guaranteed to be available for a short time in the future (until a withdrawal), which allows for a CEX like experience. A DEX can settle a ring off-chain and immediately show the final results to the user without having to wait for the on-chain settlement confirmation. Using on-chain balances, users can modify their balances/allowances directly by interfacing with the blockchain, therefore finality is only achieved when the ring settlement is confirmed on-chain.

### Higher Throughput & Lower Cost

An off-chain token transfer takes only a minimal cost for generating the proof for updating a Merkle tree. The cost of a single on-chain token transfer, however, takes roughly 20,000 gas, and checking the balance/allowance of the sender takes roughly another 5,000 gas. These costs significantly limit the possible throughput and increase the cost of rings settlement.

# Design

## Merkle Tree

A Merkle tree is used to store all the permanent data needed in the circuits.

![Merkle Tree](https://i.imgur.com/RcoayPR.png)

There are a lot of ways the Merkle tree can be structured (or can be even split up in multiple trees, like a separate tree for the trading history, or a separate tree for the fees). The Merkle tree above has a good balance between complexity, proving times and user-friendliness.

- Only a single account needed for all tokens that are or will be registered
- No special handling for anything. Every actor in the Loopring ecosystem has an account in the same tree.
- A single nonce for every account (instead of e.g. a nonce for every token a user owns) allowing off-chain requests to be ordered on the account level, which is what users will expect.
- While trading, 2 token balances are modified for a user (tokenS, tokenB). Because the balances are stored in their own sub-tree, only this smaller sub-tree needs to be updated 2 times. The account itself is modified only a single time (the balances Merkle root is stored inside the account leaf). The same is useful for e.g. operators because they also pay/receive fees in different tokens.
- The trading history tree is a sub-tree of the token balance. This may seem strange at first, but this is actually very efficient. Because the trading history is stored for tokenS, we already need to update the balance for this token, so updating the trading history only has an extra cost of updating this small sub-tree. The trading-history is not part of the account leaf because that way we'd only have 2^14 leafs for all tokens together. Note that account owners can create [a lot more orders](#Trading-History) for each token than the 2^14 slots available in this tree!

## Blocks

Work of a certain type (e.g. depositing, or ring settlements) is batched together in a block (which is not to be confused with an Ethereum block). All data necessary for all types of work is stored in the Merkle tree. A block changes the Merkle tree from the existing state to the new state by doing the state changes required in all the work in the block. These state changes can be verified on-chain by generating a ZK proof using a circuit. Only the Merkle root is stored on-chain. The actor responsible for creating and committing blocks is called the operator.

### Circuit Permutations

A circuit always does the same. There's no way to do dynamic loops or branching. Let's take the ring settlement circuit as an example:

- The circuit always settles a fixed number of rings
- The rings always contain the predetermined number of orders

We have 5 circuits:

- Settlement (aka Trade)
- Deposit
- Off-chain withdrawal
- On-chain withdrawal
- Transfers

Circuits with and without on-chain data-availability are available. We support a couple of different block sizes for each circuit type to reduce the proving time without padding too many non-op works (or long delays until the block can be completely filled). We also support block versions so we can provide multiple permutations (e.g. for compression) and are able to upgrade the circuits gracefully.

## Operators

The operator is responsible for creating, proving and submitting blocks. Blocks need to be submitted on-chain and the correctness of the work in a block needs to be proven. This is done by creating a proof.

The operator can be a simple Ethereum address or can be a complex contract allowing multiple operators to work together to submit and prove blocks. It is left up to the exchange for how this is set up.

The operator contract can also be used to enforce an off-chain data-availability system. A simple scheme could be that multiple parties need to sign off on a block before it can be committed. This can be checked in the operator contract. As long as one member is trustworthy and actually shares the data then data-availability is ensured.

The operator creates a block and submits it on-chain by calling `submitBlocks`. Multiple blocks can be submitted at the same time. All blocks will be immediately verified. If possible, batch verification is used to verify multiple blocks of the same type.

An operator can only submit new blocks when the the exchange owner has enough LRC staked. For an exchange with data-availability the exchange stake needs to be at least `minExchangeStakeWithDataAvailability`LRC and for an exchange without data-availability the stake needs to be at least `minExchangeStakeWithoutDataAvailability`LRC.

#### Only Allow Off-chain Requests to be Used Once

The **nonce** of the account is increased by 1 for these operations. The expected nonce is stored in the off-chain request which is signed by the account owner.

## Exchanges

Block submission needs to be done sequentially so the Merkle tree can be updated from a known old state to a new state. To allow concurrent settling of orders by different independent parties we allow the creation of stand-alone exchange contracts. Every exchange operates completely independently.

Note that user accounts and orders cannot be shared over different exchanges. Exchanges can decide to use the same Exchange contract so orders and users accounts can be shared if they desire.

The Loopring contract is the creator of all exchanges built on top of the Loopring protocol. This contract contains data and functionality shared over all exchanges (like the token tiers for the burn rate) and also enforces some very limited restrictions on exchanges (like a maximum withdrawal fee).

### Deposit Contract

The deposit contract is the contract that stores all the user funds and contains all the logic to transfer funds from and to a certain exchange. We allow exchanges to write their own custom deposit contract to allow exchanges the full freedom how this is handled. In the most basic case the deposit contract simply stores all user funds directly in the deposit contract and supports transferring ETH and ERC20 tokens. This is the most secure way to handle user funds, but it is inefficient because all the value locked up into the exchange is unused.

For example, a productive use of the funds would be to store the funds in a DeFi dApp that allows borrowing and lending. The exchange would earn interest on this which it could for example pass on to users directly or even indirectly by having lower fees. However, this is likely to never be completely safe so some extra precautions should be built into the contract to make sure users can withdraw all their funds. This is a delicate balance, and there is no single best solution, so we allow exchanges to decide for themselves how they want to handle this.

Another interesting possibility of the deposit contract is to support more token standards. All interaction with token contracts are done in the deposit contract, so that's the only place that needs to know how to interact with a certain token. No changes are necessary to the exchange implementation.

It's also possible to use the token addresses as seen by the exchange as a key value. Because the deposit contract handles all interaction with the token contract, the token address value seen by the exchange may differ from the actual token address. The deposit contract can simply map to the actual token address just before the interaction with the token contract. This allows, for example, the same token to be registered multiple times, but the deposit contract can store the funds in different ways. Or it can even be used to support trading multiple tranches of a single security token.

### Exchange Creation

Anyone can create a new exchange by calling `forgeExchange` on the ProtocolRegistry contract. A small amount of LRC may need to be burned to create a new exchange.

Exchange has an owner and an operator. The owner is the only one who can call some functions related to the more business side of things, like registering tokens, putting the exchange in maintenance mode and setting the operator. The operator is responsible for committing and proving blocks.

### Exchange Staking

An exchange stakes LRC. Anyone can add to the stake of an exchange by calling `depositExchangeStake`, withdrawing the stake however is only allowed when the exchange is completely [shut down](#exchange-shutdown).

The stake ensures that the exchange behaves correctly. This is done by only allows the stake to be withdrawn when the exchange is shut down by automatically returning the funds of all its users

Exchanges with a large stake have a lot to lose by not playing by the rules and have nothing to gain because the operator/owner can never steal funds for itself.

### Protocol Fee Staking

The exchange owner can stake LRC to lower the [protocol fee](#trading-protocol-fee). Anyone can add to the stake of an exchange by calling `depositProtocolFeeStake`, withdrawing the stake can be done at any time using `withdrawProtocolFeeStake`.

Note that the amount staked this way only counts for 50% to reduce the protocol fees because of the extra flexibility compared to the exchange stake. The surplus amount of LRC staked in exchange staking (i.e. everthing above the minimum amount required to commit new blocks) is counted for the complete 100%. This is to incentivize exchange staking which gives more guarantees to users.

The protocol fees can be linearly reduced from `maxProtocolTakerFeeBips` to `minProtocolTakerFeeBips` by staking `targetProtocolTakerFeeStake`LRC, and from `maxProtocolMakerFeeBips` to `minProtocolMakerFeeBips` by staking `targetProtocolMakerFeeStake`LRC.

### Exchange Shutdown

The exchange owner can choose to shut down the exchange at any time. However, the stake of an exchange can only be withdrawn when the exchange was shut down completely by returning all funds back to the users. This is done as follows:

- The exchange owner calls `shutdown` on the exchange contract. This will disallow new on-chain requests by users.
- First, all remaining open on-chain deposit requests need to be processed
- From this point on only special on-chain withdrawal blocks can be committed. These withdrawals not only withdraw the balance for a token in an account, they also reset the trading history root, the account public key, and the account nonce back to the default values of the Merkle tree
- Once the complete tree is reset to its initial state (`lastBlock.merkleRoot == genesisBlock.merkleRoot`) the exchange owner is allowed to withdraw the full stake by calling `withdrawExchangeStake`.

An exchange that is shutdown only has a limited amount of time to revert the state back to the initial state before we go into [withdrawal mode](#withdrawal-mode). This maximum amount of time can be calculated as follows:

```
maxTimeInShutdown = MAX_TIME_IN_SHUTDOWN_BASE + (numAccounts * MAX_TIME_IN_SHUTDOWN_DELTA)
```

In general, the more accounts an exchange has the more withdrawals need to be done when the exchange is shutdown. We also want to limit this amount of time because otherwise funds from users could be stuck for a long time.

This mechanism also guards users against data-availability problems. Even if the Merkle tree cannot be rebuilt by anyone but the operator, this mechanism still ensures all funds will be returned to the users, otherwise, the exchange loses the amount staked.

### Maintenance Mode

The exchange owner can put the exchange temporarily in a suspended state. This can, for example, be used to update the back-end of the exchange.

When the exchange is suspended users cannot do any on-chain requests anymore. Additionally, the operator is not allowed to commit any ring settlement blocks to prevent the exchange owner from abusing this system. The operator still needs to process all on-chain requests that are still open and needs to prove any unverified blocks, otherwise, the exchange runs the risk of getting into withdrawal mode, which is irreversible.

The exchange owner can call `startOrContinueMaintenanceMode` to burn LRC in return for downtime. `getDowntimeCostLRC` can be used to find out how much LRC needs to be sent to put the exchange in downtime for a certain amount of time. `startOrContinueMaintenanceMode` can be called multiple times to extend the downtime. `stopMaintenanceMode` can be called at any time to exit out of maintenance mode, any remaining downtime can be used at a later time. `getRemainingDowntime` can be called to find out the maximum amount of time the exchange will still remain in maintenance mode.

The exchange will get out of the maintenance mode automatically after all downtime has been used. There is currently no way to force the exchange out of this mode immediately, which can be improved in future releases.

### Token Registration

Before a token can be used in the exchange it needs to be registered, so a small token ID of 1 or 2 bytes can be used instead. Only the exchange owner can register tokens by calling `registerToken`. We ensure a token can only be registered once. ETH, WETH, and LRC are registered when the exchange is created.

We limit the token ID to just 10 bits (i.e. a maximum of ETH + 1023 tokens) to increase the performance of the circuits. It's possible that a small amount of LRC needs to be burned for registering a token. This can be checked by calling `getLRCFeeForRegisteringOneMoreToken`, this is however left up to the Loopring contract.

### Token Deposit Disabling

The exchange owner can disable deposits of a certain token by calling `disableTokenDeposit`. Depositing can be enabled again by calling `enableTokenDeposit`. This can be useful to stop supporting a certain token. Withdrawals for a token can never be disabled (unless temporarily in [maintenance mode](#maintenance-mode)).

### On-chain Fees

The owner of the exchange can set the fees for his exchange by calling `setFees`.

The following on-chain requests can require a fee to be paid in ETH to the exchange:

- Account creation
- Account update
- Depositing
- Withdrawing

An exchange is allowed to freely set the fees for any of the above. However, for withdrawals, the Loopring contract enforces a maximum fee. This is to ensure an exchange cannot stop users from withdrawing by setting an extremely high withdrawal fee.

Any function requiring a fee on-chain can be sent ETH. If the user sends more ETH than required (e.g. because the exact fee amount in hard to manually set) then the surplus is immediately sent back.

## Fee Model

### Trading Protocol Fee

This fee is proportionally applied on every token transfer part of the trade. The protocol fee can be lowered by staking LRC. A different protocol fee can be used for maker orders and taker orders.
A protocol fee value is stored in a single byte in `bips/10`. This allows us to set the protocol fee up to `0.255%` in steps of `0.001%` (`0.1 bips`).

#### Different treatment of maker and taker orders

The operator chooses which order is the maker and which order is the taker.
The first order in the ring is always the taker order, the second order is always the maker order.

### Fee/Rebate payments

Paid in the tokenB of the order. These are not taxed or do not have any other disadvantage. The order owner pays the fee to the operator respecting `feeBips`. These values are calculated on the complete amount bought, the protocol fee does not change this in any way. The operator can also pay a rebate respecting `rebateBips` to the order owners, which is also calculated on the complete amount bought.

`feeBips`'s and `rebateBips`'s maximum value is `0.63%` in steps of `0.01%` (`1 bips`).

### Buy/Sell orders

Users can decide if they want to buy a fixed number of tokens (a buy order) of if they want to sell a fixed number of tokens (a sell order). A buy order contains the maximum price the user wants to spend (by increasing amountS), a sell order contains the minimum price the users wants to get (by decreasing amountB). This allows us to do market orders. Whether an order is a buy or sell order is only important when the order is used as the taker order, the price used in the maker order is always the price defined in the order.

So if there is a positive spread between the taker and the maker order we either use the spread to buy more tokens (sell order) for the taker, or let the taker keep the spread (buy order).

### Operators pays all actual costs for a trade

The operator is in the best position to decide if a trade is profitable (and if not, he can still choose to do the trade for other reasons):

- The operator receives fees from both orders
- The operator actively monitors the side-chain/main-chain and cost for settlement

So it makes sense to also let the operator pay:

- The protocol fee for both orders
- The rebates

By letting the operator pay the protocol fees for the orders we decouple this from the fee paid by the order owners. This is useful because the `order.feeBips` can be lower than the protocol fee. Otherwise this could give issues when the protocol fee changes or when the order is used as maker/taker and different protocol fees apply.

Note that the operator normally receives fees from both orders which he can use to pay the protocol fees and/or rebates.

But if the operator pays the protocol fee, why have different protocol fee rates? You could argue that a 0.05% taker fee and a 0.01% maker fee is the same as a fixed 0.03% rate because the same entity pays the fee. That is true, but in general the operator will get a larger fee for the taker order than for the maker order so he will receive more tokens in `takerOrder.amountB` than in `makerOrder.amountB`. By having different rates it's more likely that the operator can pay the complete protocol fee just by using the tokens he receives as fee.

## Signatures

We use EdDSA keys (5,000 constraints to verify a signature), which is a bit cheaper than ECDSA signatures (estimated to be ~12,000 constraints).

The introduction of trading keypairs does have a benefit: orders no longer need to be signed by a user's Ethereum private key, DEX interfaces thus no longer need access to those Ethereum private keys. This is more secure for both users and DEXes.

The data for an EdDSA signature is stored like this:

```
Signature {
  Rx (256bit)
  Ry (256bit)
  s (256bit)
}
```

## Account Creation

Before the user can start trading he needs to create an account. An account allows a user to trade any token that is registered (or will be registered in the future).
The account is linked to the `msg.sender` that created the account, creating a one-to-one mapping between Ethereum addresses and accounts. Any future interaction with the account on-chain that needs authentication needs to be done using the same `msg.sender`.

The account needs an EdDSA public key. This public key will be stored in the Merkle tree for the account. Every request made for the account in off-chain requests (like orders) needs to be signed using the corresponding private key.

An account can be created using `createOrUpdateAccount`. When creating an account a user can also immediately deposit funds using `updateAccountAndDeposit` as both are handled by the same circuit. Both methods can also be used by users to update the EdDSA public key which is used for signing off-chain requests.

## Depositing

A user can deposit funds by calling `deposit`. If ERC-20 tokens are deposited the user first needs to approve the Exchange contract so the contract can transfer them to the contract using `transferFrom`. **ETH is supported**, no need to wrap it in WETH when using off-chain balances.

A user can also choose to deposit to the account of someone else.

Depositing can also be done when either creating or updating an account by using `updateAccountAndDeposit`.

The balance for the token in the account will be updated once it's included in a block. See [here](#on-chain-depositwithdraw-request-handling) how on-chain requests are handled.

We store the deposit information on-chain so users can withdraw from these deposited balances in withdrawal mode when the request didn't get included in a block (see [withdrawal mode](#withdrawal-mode)).

## Withdrawing

The user requests a withdrawal either on-chain or off-chain by sending the operator a withdrawal request. Once the operator has included this request in a block and the block is submitted on-chain the tokens will be automatically sent to the account owner if the transfer cost is below `GAS_LIMIT_SEND_TOKENS`. If the cost is higher the funds can still be withdrawn by anyone by calling `withdrawFromApprovedWithdrawal` (and the tokens will be sent to the account owner).

### Protocol Fee

The protocol fee is sent to the exchange account with `accountID == 0` (this account is created when the exchange is created) and can be withdrawn from the exchange to the `ProtocolFeeVault` (this address is set for all exchanges on the Loopring contract) using `withdrawProtocolFees` on the Exchange contract. The `ProtocolFeeVault` contains logic to distribute these funds between LRC stakers, LRC that will be burned, and the DAO fund. Non-LRC tokens are sold directly on-chain in a decentralized way.

### Off-chain Withdrawal Request

A request for a withdrawal is sent off-chain to the operator. The operator should include the withdrawal in a reasonable time in a block, though no guarantees can be made to the user when it will be included. **The user can pay a fee in any token he wants to the operator.**

The nonce of the account is increased after the withdrawal is processed.

```
OffchainWithdrawal {
  exchangeID (32bit)
  accountID (20bit)
  tokenID (10bit)
  amount (96bit)
  feeTokenID (10bit)
  fee (96bit)
  nonce (32bit)
}
```

An off-chain withdrawal is hashed using Poseidon/t8f6p53 in the sequence given above. The hash is signed by the Owner using the private key associated with the public key stored in `account[accountID]` with EdDSA

```
SignedOffchainWithdrawal {
  OffchainWithdrawal offChainWithdrawal
  Signature sig
}
```

`SignedOffchainWithdrawal`s can be sent to the Operators for commitment.

### On-chain Withdrawal Request

A user calls `withdraw` and the request is added to the withdrawal chain. See [here](#on-chain-depositwithdraw-request-handling) how on-chain requests are handled.

## Ring Settlement

The ring settlement is just as in protocol 2 with some limitations:

- Only 2-order rings
- No P2P orders (always use fee token)
- No on-chain registration of orders

Orders and order-matching are still completely off-chain.

**Partial order filling** is fully supported. How much an order is filled is [stored in the Merkle tree](#Trading-History). No need for users to re-sign anything if the order wasn't filled completely in a single ring, a user only needs to sign his order a single time. The order can be included in as many rings as necessary until it is completely filled.

### Off-chain Data

#### Orders

```
Order {
  exchangeID (32bit)
  orderID (64bit)
  accountID (24bit)
  tokenS (10bit)
  tokenB (10bit)
  amountS (96bit)
  amountB (96bit)
  allOrNone (1bit)
  validSince (32bit)
  validUntil (32bit)
  maxFeeBips (6bit)
  buy (1bit)
}
```

An order is hashed using Poseidon/t13f6p53 in the sequence given above. The hash is signed by the order Owner using the private key associated with the public key stored in `account[accountID]` with EdDSA.

```
SignedOrder {
  Order order
  Signature sig
}
```

`SignedOrder`s can be sent to DEXs or directly to operators for matching.

#### Rings

```
Ring {
  Order orderA
  Order orderB
  orderA_feeBips (6bit)
  orderB_feeBips (6bit)
  orderA_rebateBips (6bit)
  orderB_rebateBips (6bit)
}
```

An operator can decide how a trade is settlement, as long as all requirements specified in the orders is fulfilled. An operator can lower the fee of an order or optionally give the order owner a rebate. These can be decided freely by the operator.

The operator needs to sign a ring settlement block with the following data so he authorizes potential rebate and protocol fee payments from his account:

```
RingSettlementBlock {
  publicInput (254bit)
  nonce
}
```

This data is hashed using Poseidon/t3f6p51 in the sequence given above. The hash is signed by the operator using the private key associated with the public key stored in `account[operatorAccountID]` with EdDSA.

The nonce of the operator account is increased by 1 after the ring settlement block is processed.

## Canceling Orders

There are many ways an order can be canceled.

### Limit Validity in Time

Orders can be short-lived and the order owner can safely keep recreating orders with new validSince/validUntil times using [Order Aliasing](#Order-Aliasing) as long as they need to be kept alive.

### Updating the Account Info

The account information can be updated with a new EdDSA public key which invalidates all orders and off-chain requests of the account.

### Creating an order with a larger orderID in the same trading history slot

If an order with a larger orderID is used in a ring settlement at the same trading history slot as a previous order, the previous order is automatically canceled. Please read [Trading History](#Trading-History) to learn more about how the trading history is stored.

### The DEX removes the order in the order-book

If the order never left the DEX and the user trusts the DEX then the order can simply be removed from the order book.

## Trading History

Every account has a trading history tree with 2^14 leafs **for every token**. Which leaf is used for storing the trading history for an order is completely left up to the user, and we call this the **orderID**. The orderID is stored in a 64-bit value and works like a 2D nonce. We allow the user to overwrite the existing trading history stored at `orderID % 2^14` if `order.orderID == tradeHistory.orderID + 2^14`. If `order.orderID < tradeHistory.orderID` the order is automatically canceled. If `order.orderID == tradeHistory.orderID` we use the trading history stored in the leaf. If `order.orderID > tradeHistory.orderID + 2^14` the order cannot be used yet as the orderID can only be incremented by `2^14`. This allows the account to create 2^64 unique orders for every token, the only limitation is that only 2^14 of these orders selling a certain token can be active at the same time.

While this was done for performance reasons (so we don't have to have a trading history tree with a large depth using the order hash as an address) this does open up some interesting possibilities.

### Order Aliasing

The account owner can choose to reuse the same orderID in multiple orders. We call this Order Aliasing.

#### Safely updating the validUntil time of an order

For safety the order owner can limit the time an order is valid, and increase the time whenever he wants safely by creating a new order with a new validUntil value, without having to worry if both orders can be filled separately. This is done just by letting both orders use the same orderID.

This is especially a problem because [the operator can set the timestamp](#Timestamp-in-Circuits) that is tested on-chain within a certain window. So even when the validSince/validUntil times don't overlap it could still be possible for an operator to fill multiple orders. The order owner also doesn't know how much the first order is going to be filled until it is invalid. Until then, he cannot create the new order if he doesn't want to buy/sell more than he actually wants. Order Aliasing fixes this problem without having to calculate multiple hashes (e.g. order hash with time information and without).

#### The possibility for some simple filling logic between orders

A user could create an order selling X tokenZ for either N tokenA or M tokenB (or even more tokens) while using the same orderID. The user is guaranteed never to spend more than X tokenZ, but will have bought [0, N] tokenA and/or [0, M] tokenA.

A realistic use case would be for selling some token for one of the available stable coins. Or selling some token for ETH and WETH. In these cases the user doesn't really care which specific token he buys, but he increases his chance of finding a matching order.

## On-chain Deposit/Withdraw Request Handling

On-chain deposit and withdrawal requests are added to a small 'blockchain' on-chain. We use separate chains for deposits and withdrawals. For every request we store the following:

- The accumulated hash: The hash of the request data hashed together with the accumulated hash of the previous request.
- The accumulated fee: The fee of the request added to the accumulated fee of the previous request.
- The timestamp the request was added.

This setup allows the operator to process any number of requests in a block that he wants (though only a limited number of requests/block type are supported to limit the number of circuits, padding is done when needed). The circuits use the starting accumulated hash and the ending accumulated hash (after padding) as public input. The fee the operator receives for all the requests can easily be calculated by subtracting the accumulated fees of the last and first requests.

All requests are handled FIFO in their corresponding chain (deposit or withdrawal chain).

Onchain block fees are paid out when a block processing on-chain requests that pay an on-chain fee is submitted on-chain.

Because we want on-chain requests to be handled as quickly as possible by the operator, we enforce some limitations on him. However, we also don't want to let operators be overwhelmed by the number of on-chain requests. The following rules apply:

- The maximum number of open on-chain requests is limited by `MAX_OPEN_DEPOSIT_REQUESTS` and `MAX_OPEN_WITHDRAWAL_REQUESTS`. Anyone can check if there are available slots by calling `getNumAvailableWithdrawalSlots` or `getNumAvailableDepositSlots`.
- If there is an open on-chain request older than `MAX_AGE_REQUEST_UNTIL_FORCED` then the operator can only commit blocks containing requests like this. Priority is given to withdrawals if there are deposit and withdrawal requests forced.
- The total fee paid to the operator (the sum of all fees of all requests processed in the block) is reduced the older the requests in the block are. As a starting point for this reduction, the last processed request in the block is used. If the block is committed less than `FEE_BLOCK_FINE_START_TIME` seconds afterward the operator receives the complete fee. If not, the fee is linearly reduced for a total time of `FEE_BLOCK_FINE_MAX_DURATION`. From then on the operator does not receive any fee at all. The fine paid by the operator is burned (i.e. sold for LRC and then the LRC is burned).
- If any request that is still open is older than `MAX_AGE_REQUEST_UNTIL_WITHDRAW_MODE` we automatically go into withdrawal mode.

Current values:

```
function MAX_OPEN_DEPOSIT_REQUESTS() internal pure returns (uint16) { return 1024; }
function MAX_OPEN_WITHDRAWAL_REQUESTS() internal pure returns (uint16) { return 1024; }
function MAX_AGE_REQUEST_UNTIL_FORCED() internal pure returns (uint32) { return 15 minutes; }
function MAX_AGE_REQUEST_UNTIL_WITHDRAW_MODE() internal pure returns (uint32) { return 1 days; }
function FEE_BLOCK_FINE_START_TIME() internal pure returns (uint32) { return 5 minutes; }
function FEE_BLOCK_FINE_MAX_DURATION() internal pure returns (uint32) { return 30 minutes; }
```

## Withdrawal Mode

The operator may stop submitting new blocks and proofs at any time. If that happens we need to ensure users can still withdraw their funds.

Exchange can go in withdrawal mode when an on-chain request (either deposit or withdrawal) is open for longer than `MAX_AGE_REQUEST_UNTIL_WITHDRAW_MODE`

Once in withdrawal mode, almost all functionality of the exchange is stopped. The operator cannot submit any blocks anymore.
Users can withdraw their funds using the state of the last block that was submitted:

- Balances still stored in the Merkle tree can be withdrawn with a Merkle proof by calling `withdrawFromMerkleTree` or `withdrawFromMerkleTreeFor`.
- Deposits not yet included in a sumbitted block can be withdrawn using `withdrawFromDepositRequest`
- Approved withdrawals can manually be withdrawn (even when not in withdrawal mode) using `withdrawFromApprovedWithdrawal`


## Conditional Transfers

Conditional transfers are transfers that are approved on-chain by the account owner or an [agent](#Agents) of the account owner by calling `approveOffchainTransfer`. No signature or other authorization is needed for the operator to do an off-chain transfer that was approved like this. This allows any on-chain mechanism (done by the account owner himself or by an [agent](#Agents)) to decide if a transfer can happen or not.


## Agents

An agent is an address that is allowed to authorize on-chain operations for the account owner. By definition the account owner is an agent for himself. `authorizeAgents` can be used by an agent to authorize or de-authorize other agents.

Agents can be simple EOAs or other smart contracts. Smart contracts are the most interesting case. This allows extending the exchange functionality by implementing extra logic on top of the basic exchange functionality that's built into the exchange contract. There's a lot functionality that can be added this way for users. Some examples:
  - [Layer 1 composability](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/composability-between-ethereum-layer-1-and-2-10650b7411e5)
  - Fast withdrawals (by using a [conditional transfer](#Conditional-Transfers))
  - Support for any 3rd party meta-transactions
  - ...

## Wallets

Wallets are where users create orders. The wallet can work together with DEXs and operators to get part of the trading fees. Either direclty by using a contract as an intermediate fee-recipient so fees can be shared using a smart contract logic.

## Brokers

A broker is someone that can manage orders for an account it does not own.

The account system is used for this. Users can create a special account for a broker and deposit funds the broker is able to use. This is done by setting `account.publicKey` to the public key of the broker instead of the order owner. To stop the broker from being able to fill orders the balance can be withdrawn or the public key stored in the account can be changed.

## Timestamp in Circuits

A block and its proof are always made for a fixed input. The operator cannot accurately know on what timestamp the block will be processed on the Ethereum blockchain, but he needs a fixed timestamp to create a block and its proof (the chosen timestamp impacts which orders are valid and invalid).

We do however know the approximate time the block will be committed on the Ethereum blockchain. When committing the block the operator also includes the timestamp he used in the block (as a part of the public data). This timestamp is checked against the timestamp on-chain and if the difference is less than `TIMESTAMP_HALF_WINDOW_SIZE_IN_SECONDS` the block can be committed.

## On-chain Data

From the yellow paper:

- 4 gas is paid for every zero byte of data or code for a transaction
- 16 gas is paid for every non-zero byte of data or code for a transaction

In the calculations below we use 16 gas/byte for our data-availability data.

#### Data-availability for ring settlements

```
- Operator account ID: 3 bytes
- For every ring
    - For both Orders:
        - Account ID: 3 bytes
        - Trade history data: 2 bytes
        - TokenS: 1,5 bytes
        - FillS: 3 bytes （24 bits, 19 bits for the mantissa part and 5 for the exponent part)
        - Order data (feeOrRebateBips): 1 byte
```

- => **21 bytes/ring**
- => Calldata cost: 21 \* 16 = **336 gas/ring**

This data data is further transformed to make it more compressable:

- To group more similar data together we don't store all data for a ring next to each other but group them together for all rings. For _all_ rings, sequentially:
  - orderA.tradeHistoryData + orderB.tradeHistoryData
  - orderA.accountID + orderB.accountID
  - orderA.tokenS + orderB.tokenS
  - orderA.fillS + orderB.fillS
  - orderA.orderData
  - orderB.orderData

#### Data-availability for transfers

```
- Operator account ID: 3 bytes
- For every transfer:
    - Type: 1 bytes
    - From account ID: 3 bytes
    - To account ID: 3 bytes
    - Token ID: 1,5 bytes
    - Fee token ID: 1,5 bytes
    - Amount: 3 bytes （24 bits, 19 bits for the mantissa part and 5 for the exponent part)
    - Fee amount: 2 bytes （16 bits, 11 bits for the mantissa part and 5 for the exponent part)
```

- => **15 bytes/transfer**
- => Calldata cost: 15 \* 16 = **240 gas/transfer**

#### Withdrawal data

```
// Approved withdrawal data
- For every withdrawal:
    - Token ID: 2 bytes
    - Account ID: 3 bytes
    - Amount: 3 bytes （24 bits, 19 bits for the mantissa part and 5 for the exponent part)

// Data-availability
- Operator account ID: 3 bytes
- For every withdrawal:
    - Fee token ID: 2 bytes
    - Fee amount: 2 bytes （16 bits, 11 bits for the mantissa part and 5 for the exponent part)
```

- => On-chain: **8 bytes/withdrawal**
- => On-chain withdrawal calldata cost: 8 \* 16 = **128 gas/on-chain withdrawal**
- => With data-availability: **12 bytes/withdrawal**
- => With data-availability calldata cost: 12 \* 16 = **192 gas/off-chain withdrawal**

## Throughput (Trade Settlements)

The throughput is limited by:

- The cost of the data we have to send in the calldata for the on-chain data-availability.
- The `2^28` constraints limit that allows for efficient proof generation.

Without data-availability, we are only limited by the number of constraints in a single block.

The gas limit in an Ethereum block is 10,000,000 gas. An Ethereum block is generated every ~13 seconds (this is the case since the Muir Glacier HF).

### On-chain Data-availability Limit

- Submitting a block (batched): ~220,000 gas (fixed cost) + ~80,000 gas/block
- => Using 27 blocks of 1024 trades/block: (10,000,000 - 300,000) / 336 = **29000 trades/Ethereum block = ~2200 trades/second**)

### Constraints Limit

We can only prove circuits with a maximum of `2^28` ~= 268M constraints efficiently (the roots-of-unity of the alt_bn128 curve is `2^28`, so we need to stay below `2^28` constraints so we can use FFT for generating the proof).

Currently, our ring settlement circuit with data-availability support uses ~71,000 constraints/ring:

- `2^28` / 71,000 = 3800 trades/block

Our ring settlement circuit without data-availability support uses ~63,000 constraints/ring (this is cheaper than with data-availability because we don't have to hash the data-availability data in the circuit):

- `2^28` / 63,000 = 4250 trades/block

### Results

In a single block, we are currently limited by the number of constraints used in the circuit. Mutliple blocks can be submitted at once (+ more efficient batch verification for circuits of the same type) to mitigate this.

Using 7 blocks with on-chain data-availability (so that we are limited by the cost of data-availability):

- => (10,000,000 - (220,000 + 7 \* 80,000) / 336 = ~27500 trades/Ethereum block = **~2100 trades/second**

Without data-availability we are limited by how many blocks (and thus by how many trades/block) we can submit in a single Ethereum block:

- => (10,000,000 - 220,000) / 80,000 = ~125 blocks/Ethereum block
- = ~4250 trades/block \* 125 blocks/Ethereum block = ~531,250 trades/Ethereum block = **~41,000 trades/second**

For comparison, let's calculate the achievable throughput of the previous Loopring protocols that did the ring settlements completely on-chain.

- Gas cost/ring settlement: ~300,000 gas
- => 10,000,000 / 300,000 = 33 trades/Ethereum block = **2-3 trades/second**.

- _Cost in USD per Trade_ in the table does not cover off-chain proof generation.

### Future Improvements

Without on-chain data-availability the throughput can increase another order of magnitude with [recursive SNARKs](https://ethresear.ch/t/reducing-the-verification-cost-of-a-snark-through-hierarchical-aggregation/5128).

### Proof Generation Cost

Using an AWS server we can [generate proofs](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/zksnark-prover-optimizations-3e9a3e5578c0) for circuits with `2**28` contraints in ~7 minutes costing ~\$0.000042/trade.

# Case Studies

## DEX with CEX-like Experience

### Setting up the exchange

The DEX can decide to use an existing exchange so it does not need to set up its own infrastructure to handle block creation and creating proofs. This also makes it possible to share orders with all other parties using that exchange.

In this case study, let's create a new exchange. The exchange owner just needs to call `createExchange` on the Loopring contract. This creates a brand new exchange contract.

### Trading

Users create orders using accounts created on the exchange. Orders are added to the order books of the DEX.

The DEX matches the order with another order. The order gets completely filled in the ring:

- The GUI of the DEX can be updated immediately with the state after the ring settlement. The order can be shown as filled, but not yet verified.
- The DEX sends the ring to the operator(s) of the exchange. Because these rings need to be settled in a reasonable time the operator calls `submitBlocks` after receiving a sufficient number of rings.

The DEX could now show an extra 'Verified" symbol for the filling of the order.

An order can be in the following states:

- **Unmatched** in an order-book
- **Matched** by the DEX
- **Submitted** in a block sent and verified on-chain in `submitBlocks`

Only when the block is submitted on-chain is the ring settlement irreversible.

## Deposit and Withdrawal Process

The first thing a user needs to do is create an account. The user has the option to directly deposit tokens to this new account to be created.

`updateAccountAndDeposit` is called on the exchange contract. A new account is created on-chain (the on-chain account information does not contain any balance information because the balance will only be used and updated in the Merkle tree) and the necessary data is hashed together that needs to be used for creating the account in the Merkle tree in the circuit. The amount of tokens the user deposits to the contract will be stored in the leaf of the Merkle tree with address `accountID` (together with the rest of the account information).

The Merkle tree has not yet been updated. This needs to be done by the operator by committing a deposit block containing the deposit by the user. As long as the account is not added to the Merkle tree the account cannot be used.

The operator can stop working before this is done, however. That's why the amount deposited is stored somewhere on-chain so that the user can withdraw these funds in withdrawal mode.

But the operator wants to earn fees so he creates a block that adds the account to the Merkle tree. After the account is added in the circuit, it can immediately be used.

The account balance is updated between trades as you'd expect.

The user then wants to withdraw (a part of) the balance. He can let the operator know on-chain, or he can just send a request off-chain. The only difference is that when the request is made off-chain the operator can choose when to do the withdrawal so there is no guarantee when it will be done. In any case, there will be a delay between the request for withdrawal and when the operator includes the withdrawal in a block. In this period the operator is free to keep using the balances in the account to settle rings.

After some time the operator includes the withdrawal in a block. Two things are done when this happens:

- The balance in the Accounts Merkle tree is subtracted with the amount withdrawn in the circuit (if possible of course, otherwise nothing is withdrawn)
- The smart contract distributes the withdrawals if possible, otherwise the amount is stored on-chain so it can be withdrawn later using `withdrawFromApprovedWithdrawal`
