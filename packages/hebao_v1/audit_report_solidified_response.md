## ABOUT

This document contains our response to the audit report from Solidified.

## STATUS

A work in progress.

## Response

### 1. BaseVault.execute(..) transactions can be replayed.

Addressed by PR https://github.com/Loopring/protocols/pull/1185

### 2. Reentrancy vulnerability in MetaTxModule.sol, function executeTransactions()

Addressed by PR https://github.com/Loopring/protocols/pull/1188

### 3. Mathint.sol does not prevent underflow/overflow.

Addressed by PR https://github.com/Loopring/protocols/pull/1181

### 4. Deployer key holds a vast amount of power.

We will manage the admin account using a two-layer solution. The first layer is a third-party multisig wallet, and the controlling keys are cold. This multisig wallet will NOT directly manage our contracts but will maintain a list of _managers_ who will directly manage the contracts.

The multisig wallet thus is not considered to be part of the Hebao smart contract codebase.

### 5. MetaTxModule.sol: Transactions without nonce are allowed

### 6. MathUint.decodeFloat() does not revert on overflow

Addressed by PR https://github.com/Loopring/protocols/pull/1182

### 7. Guardian and owner could be the same address

Addressed by PR https://github.com/Loopring/protocols/pull/1187

### 8. MetaTxModule.sol: Relayer can cause transactions to fail by sending just above the limit the user provided.

Addressed by PR https://github.com/Loopring/protocols/pull/1186

### 9. CompoundModule.sol and Inheritance: Deposits and withdraws to Compound and change of Inheritance settings are allowed with a locked wallet.

### 10. BaseSubAccount.sol: Function canDepositToken currently returning withdrawable amount.

### 11. BaseSubAccount.sol: Functions TokenReturnAmount and tokenWithdrawable do not implement functionality for ETH.

### 12. ModuleRegistry.sol: Contract is owned by only one address.

See issue# 4 for the same solution.

### 13. Consider using Uniswap V2 price oracle

### 14. Attacks by malicious guardians

### 15. Dapp Modules can bypass quotas and whitelists

Dapps that are whitelisted will bypass quotas **by design**. One principle we have is only to whitelist dapps that transfer Ether/token back to the original user address.
We are removing Dapps modules, and adding a new `DappModule`to interact with whitelisted dapps. https://github.com/Loopring/protocols/pull/1189 and https://github.com/Loopring/protocols/pull/1184

### 16. Vault can have more than MAX_OWNER owners

Addressed in PR https://github.com/Loopring/protocols/pull/1185 and https://github.com/Loopring/protocols/pull/1184

### 17. MetaTxModule.sol, ApprovedTransfers.sol: Return value of operations in collectTokens and reimburseGasFee is not being verified

Addressed in PR https://github.com/Loopring/protocols/pull/1189 and https://github.com/Loopring/protocols/pull/1184

### 18. The initialization method initManager() could be front-run, unless it is called within the same transaction as the creation of the contract.

Addressed by PR https://github.com/Loopring/protocols/pull/1194

### 19. AddressSet.sol

Addressed by PR https://github.com/Loopring/protocols/pull/1195

### 20. Possible misleading comment in Module.sol

Addressed by PR https://github.com/Loopring/protocols/pull/1195

### 21. Consider removing the option to make delegateCalls from wallet and vault

This method is not used and is internal only. We'll keep it there just in case there are use cases in the future.

### 22. Consider implementing a receive() function for no-data calls.

We implemented the `receive` function after sending the code for review: https://github.com/Loopring/protocols/blob/fc0a9bfdf82f07ccc60535b1a85493a29b897a6c/packages/hebao_v1/contracts/base/BaseWallet.sol#L226
