## #02 [Rejected] LOW

- PR: https://github.com/Loopring/protocol/pull/50

Description : According to ERC-20 token standards, 
Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the Transfer event.
(https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-20-token-standard.md)
But in your method "transferToken" TokenTransferDelegate you have put a check against it. Either it should be allowed or a note should be added.

### Remark:
This really isn't a bug. In our protocol, if the value to be transfered is 0, we don't call the transfer method at all.

Hello,

Here are my initial suggestions from a static analysis of your smart contracts code. Please note that I am just an enthusiast of Solidity and Bug Bounty campaigns, so you shouldn't take my suggestions for granted. Please review it carefully and only if you agree with it, implement the necessary changes. If you are satisfied with it, I can continue the testing to provide you more feedback.

There are some usages of "var" which infers the variable type from the right hand of the assignment. I recommend avoiding this feature because in some cases it might infer a smaller integer type than the developer might think. It is best to be explicit regarding types;
Consider avoiding the usage of "for" loop as iterating through the array of unknown size might consume all the gas provided (run out of gas). Especially, try to avoid loops in your functions or actions that modify large areas of storage (this includes clearing or copying arrays in storage). For example, here:
  
    for (uint i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
      if (tokens[i] == _token) {
        tokens[i] == tokens[tokens.length - 1];
        tokens.length --;
        break;
      }
    } 

if the tokens array becomes very large, the transaction to unregisterTokenwill never succeed.
assert(ERC20(token).transferFrom(from, to, value));
Please make sure that "assert" is used intentionally, as if it fails, all the gas is consumed. Consider replacing "assert" with "require". Require() is used for checking that the input of the function is well formatted, while assert() function is used to validate contract state after making changes .

That’s all for now. Please, let me know if you find any of these relevant. Good luck with your project!
Regards,

### Remark:
The unregistraton function will be called very rarely; "not use assert" is a known optimization for the team.

## #04 [Rejected]

- Resolution: We consider the current math to be safe.
 
Hi,
 
So it seems like every calculation you’re doing that is critical (i.e. involves money in some way) is done using SafeMath functions, which is great. Though there are a few places that this isn’t the case:
In settleRing there’s a (state.fillAmountS - prev.splitB) and a (prev.splitB + state.splitS) to calculate transfer balances. Seems like this is very critical and should be using SafeMath functions, even though you could argue all code before should make this unnecessary, it still seems like the safe thing to do. You never know how the code might be modified in the future.
In calculateRingFees there’s (minerLrcSpendable += lrcSpendable). Again, probably unnecessary now, but the calculation involves real money so probably smart to take all precautions.

## #05 [MERGED] - LOW

- From: jonasshen
- Resolution: https://github.com/Loopring/protocol/issues/70

### Remark:
This is more of a incomplete feature rather than a bug. But we decided to reward this report.


## #06 [MERGED] - LOW

Hi Team

In the unregister function, we have below check on whether the token/symbol is already registerred or not.

    require(tokenSymbolMap[_symbol] == _token);

Only for registerred symbol/token, the check will give one pass and then the unregister codes will be executed.
However, for the case when `_token` is gave one value of address(0),
the check will also give one pass even if the symbol is not registerred.
We'd better add the check `require(_token != address(0));`. This will make our contract stronger.

```
-----------------------------------------------------------
function unregisterToken(address _token, string _symbol)
    external
    onlyOwner
{
    require(tokenSymbolMap[_symbol] == _token);
    delete tokenSymbolMap[_symbol];
    delete tokenMap[_token];
    for (uint i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
        if (tokens[i] == _token) {
            tokens[i] = tokens[tokens.length - 1];
            tokens.length --;
            break;
        }
    }
}
-----------------------------------------------------------
```

### Remark:
The point is valid. But even without a fix, the unregisterToken still works but it will cost more gas.
