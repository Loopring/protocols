## Design

Please check out our [whitepaper](https://github.com/Loopring/whitepaper/raw/master/en_whitepaper.pdf) to understand the design and features of the Loopring Protocol.

## Optimizations

We have performed several smart contract gas usage optimization with very good results:

- [gas_consume_report_1025](gas_consume_report_1025.md)
- [gas_consume_report_1026](gas_consume_report_1026.md)
- [gas_consume_report_1108](gas_consume_report_1108.md)

## Deployments

Please visit [this](https://loopring.github.io/docs/) site for various versions of the protocol deployed on top of Ethereum mainnet and testnets, as well as ERC20 tokens that can be traded with Loopring.
