- loopring_v3: Loopring Protocol
- hebao_v1: Loopring's smart-wallet implementation.


## How to release

- Create a branch called `release_loopring_x.x.x` or `release_hebao_x.x.x` (all lower cases)
- Create a release based called `loopring.x.x.x` or `hebao_x.x.x` (all lower cases）， the tag name shall be the same as the release name.
- Add as many notes as possible to describe what's new in the release.
